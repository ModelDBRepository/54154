Abstract:

A detailed knowledge of the quantitative properties of the 
currents I(Na) and I(K) underlying the action potential is 
essential for a deeper understanding of neuronal excitatory
 processes. However, it is not always possible or practical
 to perform voltage-clamp measurements that usually provide
 the necessary data. In this paper, we present a method by
which the activation and kinetic properties of these 
currents can be estimated from current-clamp data, more 
precisely from the time course of the action potential, 
provided some additional electrophysiological properties
of the neurone are a priori known. We report results from
thalamocortical neurones and a cortical pyramidal cell, 
and suggest that the method will work with other types of 
neurones, if their action potentials are primarily shaped 
by I(Na) and I(K).
