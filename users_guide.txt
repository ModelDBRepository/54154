to software estimating activation and kinetic properties of INa and IK of
the action potential from current-clamp records. Please note that

1. Prepare 2 types of data files both having the structure of `burst' data
as described in the programmes in_estim2*.m from the *same* neurone.
1.1 `Burst' type data with hyperpolarising input currents to be used by
the programmes in_estim2*.m
1.2 `Burst' type data with action potentials evoked by depolarising input
     currents to be used by the programmes in_estim4*.m.
Ensure in both cases that the file starts before the stimulus; is long enough,
typically a few hundred ms; and has a high enough resolution (small sampling
time Delta_t<=0.033 ms for traces containing action potentials; larger 
Delta_t are allowed for the hyperpolarising stimuli). 
Also collect all input data (e.g. activation and kinetic parameter values 
for the known currents, rev. pot.s etc.) that are required for the input of 
the programmes to be used, and load them before using the analysis programmes 
or their driver scripts.

2. Estimate the total membrane capacitance and the maximal conductances of
the a priori known currents, as well as the rev. pot. EL of the leakage current.
To this end use the programmes in_estim2*.m, or rather their driver scripts 
to obtain the estimates for the parameters above from each trace of the data
set. Select the appropriate variant depending on what currents are regarded 
to be present and activated by the hyperpolarising stimuli. 
	You can select the "best" set of estimates in several ways using a
neurone model to simulate the current-clamp records. One is to take each 
indiviual set of estimates and to find the one which requires minimal overall
adjustments in the input and holding current in the simulations throughout
the whole spectrum of the stimuli. Another criterion could be the smallest 
cumulative least square error of the simulated fits over all traces when
applying the experimental stimuli to the model.

3. Compute the current ci0=INa+IK with the "best" set of estimates by using
in_estim4bc.m. This procedure also computes hNa(t), the time evolution of the
inactivation var. of INa; the resting membrane potential Er (at which Ihold
should be zero - an experimental condition), and the current stimulus 
ci2. In addition, the time course of the currents IA and IT is also computed.
However, the order of the Chebyshev approximation should be chosen carefully.
A too low order (value of mch) yields grossly inaccurate results, while a too
high order intorduces numerical instabilities manifested in oscillations.
Experinece has showed that the order chosen is acceptable if the maximal
absolute error of the approximation of V(t) is <0.6 mV; and a further 
increase of the approximation order does not improve the goodness of the 
fit significantly. Also, the ci0 curves obtained with 2 consecutive mch
values should only differ slightly. 
N.B. In some cases, either even or odd orders yield numerically unstable results
with oscillations. In these cases, only odd and even orders of approximations
should be used, respectively.

4. Calculate first estimates of the parameters of INa current in terms of 
the alpha-beta-type description using in_estim5c.m. The parameters estimated
are listed in this programme. Check the quality of the estimates by
graphically displaying the raw values of alpha_mNa(V) and beta_mNa(V) 
((1+lambda)*alpNa0, lambda*betNa0) obtained from the initial segment of
ci0, where ci0 approximately equals INa, and the estimated ones (alpNae, 
betNae). Also display ci0 and the reconstructed INa as another test of the
estimation. Save the results and all other parameters used in a file.

5. Calculate the estimates of the parameters of IK (tc_estim6a.m) and INa
(tc_estim7df.m) for a series of mKmx=max(mK) values, where mK=mK(t) is the
time course of the activation variable of IK. To this end, use the programme
script script_6a_7df.m. Edit this script to enter the correct file name for
the file created in the preceding step (e.g. input_data.dat), and for the new
one containing the estimation results (e.g. new_estimation.res). 

6. Choose the parameter set with the minimal error. Save the results and 
other parameter values in a new file. Fix the value of mKmx corresponding
to the minimal error and re-run script_6a7df.m with this new file loaded 
and with disabled the while loop (comment it out), that is, run tc_estim6a.m 
and tc_estim7df.m only once each. If the error of the estimation decreased, 
accept the new set of parameter values for IK and INa, and repeat this 
procedure until the error starts increasing rapidly. (This might happen 
already in the first `round'.) Note that you can stop after running only
tc_estim6a.m and regard the parameter set obtained as `optimal', if the 
error produced by tc_estim6a.m is smaller than before but the subsequent error 
produced by tc_estim7df.m is much larger than that of tc_estim6a.m. 

7. Check the quality of the estimated values by comparing ci0 with the 
reconstructed INa+IK, or comparing ci0-IK with INa, or ci0-INa with IK. 
Moreover, it is a good idea to visualise the steady-state activation curves 
and the voltage dependence of the kinetics of both INa and IK. (See output 
of tc_estim6a.m and tc_estim7df.m.) 
If these checks look all right, use the parameter set obtained in a neurone
model to reproduce the action potential. Make small adjustments, if necessary,
during the simulations.

8. Other types of description of the activation and kinetics of IK and INa
can be used by modifying the programmes tc_estim6a.m, fm2.m, tc_estim7df.m,
fm2df.m, and the programme script script_6a7df.m.
